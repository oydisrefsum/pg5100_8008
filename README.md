# Exam enterprise 1

start application for testing/debugging from LocalRunnerApplication found in frontend/src/test/java/org.tsdes/

### Using code from github repo
https://github.com/arcuri82/testing_security_development_enterprise_systems
All files which are coped or adapted from repo has a comment on top of file
### Briefly discuss solution:
The application homepage has 12 already added movies, some of wich are rated by already added users.
You will se a log in button and a sign up button, as well as a message at the bottom.
When you sign in/ log in you will get a welcome message. And you are now able to add a review to a movie.

If you click the title of the movie you will be taken to the details page about the movie. 
If you are not logged in/signed up you will not be able to add your review but once you are logged in you can give your ratings.

A user can only give a movie one rating.

There are two options for sorting the reviews. one for sorting by stars, and one for sorting by date written.

There is possible to log out from every page aswell as the possabilitiy to go back to homepage by clicking home.
